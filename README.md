Rotomoon launched its token on 18th April 2021 with a total supply of 288,288,288,000,000 ROTO tokens.

Each transaction has a 10% fee, which is split in two different ways:
ROTO holders receive a proportional 5% commission on each transaction. This auto-staking method rewards holders avoiding Impermanent Loss.
5% of fees are received as LP tokens which offer half of their value in BNB and the other half in ROTO. Out of this amount of ROTO an 85% is periodically burned (Deflation) and a 15% is reserved for community raffles.
Within the corresponding amount of BNB, an 80% is stocked for donations and a 20% for marketing and logistics.
